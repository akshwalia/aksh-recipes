This is my first project of web development.

I'll be making a website contains a few receipes which will have links to the respective recipes. I'll also add pictures to make the website look a little more intuitive. 

Skills that I have acquired so far:
 HTML boiler plate
 Adding bold and italics
 Adding absolute and relative links in HTML
 Adding pictures in HTML
